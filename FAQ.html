                <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="collapsible"  >
        What should I do if my tenant does not pay their rent?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Contact the tenant: Start by reaching out to the tenant to find out why the rent has not been paid. It's possible that there has been a misunderstanding or a financial issue that can be resolved with communication. Send a notice: If the tenant does not respond to your attempts to contact them, you can send a notice to pay rent or quit. This is a legal document that gives the tenant a certain amount of time (usually 3-5 days) to pay the rent or vacate the property. File an eviction: If the tenant does not pay the rent or vacate the property within the specified time, you can file for an eviction with your local court. The court will issue a summons and the tenant will have an opportunity to respond. Consider hiring a lawyer: If the situation becomes complicated or the tenant contests the eviction, it may be helpful to hire a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal process. Collect the debt: If the tenant owes you money for unpaid rent or damages to the property, you can take legal action to collect the debt. This may involve garnishing wages or placing a lien on the tenant's property.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        What paperwork should I ask my prospective tenant to provide when they are applying to rent my investment property?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Rental application: The rental application should include the tenant's contact information, employment history, rental history, and references. It will also typically require the tenant's consent to a credit and background check.

            Photo identification: You should ask the tenant to provide a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or passport, to verify their identity.

            Proof of income: You should ask the tenant to provide proof of their income, such as pay stubs or tax returns. This will help you ensure that the tenant can afford the rent and has a stable income.

            Credit report: You should ask the tenant to provide a recent credit report. This will give you an idea of the tenant's creditworthiness and ability to pay bills on time.

            References: You should ask the tenant to provide references from previous landlords or other professional references. This can help you get a sense of the tenant's character and behavior as a renter.

            Rental history: You should ask the tenant to provide a rental history, including the names and contact information of previous landlords. This can help you verify the tenant's rental history and ensure that they have a good track record as a renter.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Collect the security deposit and first month's rent: Before the tenant moves in, you should collect the security deposit and first month's rent. Be sure to provide a receipt and keep accurate records of all payments.

            Conduct a move-in inspection: You should conduct a move-in inspection with the tenant to document the condition of the rental property. This should include a written checklist and photographs or videos. Both you and the tenant should sign the checklist to acknowledge its accuracy.

            Provide the tenant with keys and access: You should provide the tenant with keys and any necessary access codes or instructions for entering the property.

            Provide contact information: You should provide the tenant with your contact information, including your phone number and email address, in case they need to reach you for any reason.

            Review the lease agreement with the tenant: You should review the lease agreement with the tenant to ensure that they understand all of the terms and conditions. This includes the rent amount, due date, and any other fees or charges.

            Provide any necessary instructions: You should provide the tenant with any necessary instructions for operating appliances, heating and cooling systems, and other features of the rental property.

            Sign all necessary documents: You and the tenant should sign all necessary documents, including the lease agreement, move-in inspection checklist, and any other addendums or disclosures.</p>
